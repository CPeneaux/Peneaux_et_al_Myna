## ABSTRACT
Foragers have to sample foods in their environment to obtain adequate levels of energy and nutrients depending on their current nutritional needs. The production of carotenoid-based sexual signals in birds likely relies upon a balance of macronutrients and dietary carotenoids but it is not currently known whether individuals can consume foods selectively to achieve optimal colouration. Here, we experimentally manipulated the access of macronutrients and carotenoids in common mynas (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>) and used signal coloration as a proxy for optimal nutrient balance. Mynas adjusted their macronutrient intake based on sex and whether or not their diet contained carotenoids. All mynas consuming carotenoids had raised levels of plasma carotenoids, but only males that could also freely select macronutrients had the highest levels of circulating carotenoids. Intake of dietary carotenoids improved coloration in males but had no effect on female coloration. The overall pattern of dietary choices suggests sex-specific nutritional strategies for this species, with males selecting macronutrient combinations that increased pigments absorption for signal expression and females potentially maximizing nutrient intake for reproductive functions.
