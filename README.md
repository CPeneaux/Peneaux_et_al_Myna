## ABSTRACT
Foragers have to sample foods in their environment to obtain adequate levels of energy and nutrients depending on their current nutritional needs. The production of carotenoid-based sexual signals in birds likely relies upon a balance of macronutrients and dietary carotenoids. However, the nutritional dynamics associated with carotenoid-based traits remains to be further explored. To address this vexing question, we experimentally manipulate the access of macronutrients and carotenoids in common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and used signal coloration as a proxy for optimal nutrient balance. Mynas adjusted their macronutrient intake based on sex and also access to dietary carotenoids. Moreover, mynas supplemented with carotenoids had raised levels of plasma carotenoids. Specifically, males, but not females, that had access to carotenoids and could also freely select macronutrients had the highest levels of circulating carotenoids. Intake of dietary carotenoids improved coloration in males but had no effect on female coloration. The overall pattern of dietary choices suggests sex-specific nutritional strategies for this species, with females potentially maximizing nutrient intake for reproductive functions and males selecting macronutrient combinations that increased pigments absorption for signal expression.
